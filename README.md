# Classifying-Wine-with-k-nearest-neighbours
We are going to be working with the Wine dataset. This is a 178 sample dataset that categorises 3 different types of Italian wine using 13 different features. 

In the notebook I develop a 5-fold nested cross-validation with k-NN which is used to classify the 3 wine types.
